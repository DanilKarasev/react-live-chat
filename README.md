# Real - time chat

## UI

You can sign up a new user with any data, or use test account for authorization.

For login:\
e-mail: `test@test.test`\
password: `123456`

You can add\remove chats, move through chat windows, change user data.\
Also there is a feature as vocabular dictionary. Added just for practice with API.

## Logics

Redux-saga as middleware, Firebase as database.\
On earlier builds there was a redux-persist, but currently it has only dictionary data.

### Adaptivity

It was build as desktop app, but can run on most devices.
